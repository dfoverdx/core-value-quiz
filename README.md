## Core Values Quiz ##

This "quiz" presents 58 possible core values.  It presents two values at a time.  You choose which of the two is more 
important to you and [QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) does the rest.  Once you've completed the 
quiz, an ordered list is displayed with the option to save your results to a text file.

The core values used were pulled from [this PDF](http://thehappinesstrap.com/upimages/complete_worksheets_for_The_Confidence_Gap.pdf).

### Future work ###

In the future, I would like to keep track of people's results (anonymously) in order to see if there's any clustering
that can be done between the values.  Do people that highly value compassion, also highly value authenticity?  Who knows
if I'll ever actually get around to writing that code.
